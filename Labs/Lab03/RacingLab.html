<h1>Introduction to Racing Threads Lab.</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Go into your <code><strong>CSI500</strong></code> directory that should
    contain our CSI500 git repository which you started with <code><strong>git
    clone git@github.com:chaikens/CSI500</strong></code>, and which you added
    to during previous labs. Do the command below: 
    <p></p>
    <pre><strong>git pull origin master</strong></pre>
    <p>A text editor might take over your terminal window with a comment about
    this being a merge. Just exit the editor. By default it will be the vi
    editor, and the commands to simply exit without changing any text are
    <code><strong>ESC :wq </strong></code>hh(That's the Excape key first. The
    ESC stops text edit mode and <code><strong>:wq</strong></code> tells it to
    write out the file and then quit.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>Make your shell change working directory to
    <code><strong>Labs/Lab03</strong></code> (Remember
    <code><strong>cwd</strong></code>) and use <code><strong>ls -l
    </strong></code> to see what we gave you. WRITE IN YOUR NOTES, or better,
    KEEP A COPY OF the files listed BEFORE you proceed with making the software
    by commanding: <code><strong>ls -l &gt; files_before_making
    </strong></code>(The <code><strong>&gt; </strong></code>symbol in this
    shell command tells the shell to open a disk file
    named<code><strong>files_before_making</strong></code> and redirect the
    standard output file descriptor so it describes this disk file instead of
    the text terminal.) 
    <p>Q1: Write in the file <code><strong>HW2Questions.txt</strong></code>
    this list of files. </p>
    <p>We will ask you to report what new files are commanded to be made by the
    <code><strong>Makefile</strong></code>. You should only pay attention to
    the files at the top level of directory
    <code><strong>Lab03</strong></code>, not any in the subdirectories.</p>
  </li>
  <li>View in your text editor 
    <p>first <code><strong>racer.c</strong></code>: It has a loop that makes
    the thread repeatedly add 1 to a shared variable in memory (apparently).
    </p>
    <p>second, <code><strong>racer.h</strong></code>: The interface to the
    racer function.</p>
    <p>third, <code><strong>raceDriver.c</strong></code>: Don't spend time
    studying it all now, but note that the <code><strong>racer</strong></code>
    function is NOT CALLED EXPLICITLY with
    <code><strong>racer(</strong></code>ANYTHING<code><strong>);</strong></code>
    but rather its name is one argument in the POSIX call to create a thread
    and get it to run the <code><strong>racer</strong></code> loop.</p>
    <p></p>
    <pre><strong> pthread_create(&amp;threads[i], NULL, racer, (void *) i);</strong></pre>
    <p style="margin-left:2em;"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Important C rule
    in kernel programming: The plain name of a function, with no ()'s, denotes
    the address of the first machine instruction of the function's body. In
    other words, the name denotes the function pointer pointing to that
    function. (Note this rule is similar to the one about arrays: The plain
    name denotes the address of the first element and the name followed by
    [ANYTHING] denotes the variable that happens to be the array element with
    index given by the value denoted by ANYTHING.)</span> </p>
  </li>
  <li>Command: <code><strong>make help </strong></code>(When you
    <strong><code>make help</code> </strong>at the top of a Linux kernel source
    tree, you get instructions like this.)<strong></strong></li>
  <li>Command: <code><strong>make config</strong></code> Leave the contents of
    the editor buffer unchanged by typing <code><strong>C-x</strong></code>
    Next, command: <code><strong>make </strong>(<strong>make
    </strong></code><strong><em>some configuration</em></strong> followed by
    <code><strong>make </strong></code><em><strong>what you want</strong></em>
    is the common pattern that people who build kernels do day-to-day.)</li>
  <li>LAB Q2: Write in the file <code><strong>HW2Questions.txt</strong></code>
    the names of the files (top level only) made during the last step. Command:
    <code><strong>git add HW2Questions.txt </strong></code> and
    <strong><code>git commit -m "Did the first make and answered
    Q2"</code></strong> Finally, command: <strong><code>git log
    -p</code></strong></li>
  <li>LAB Q3: Write in file
    <code><strong><code>HW2Questions.txt</code></strong></code><code><strong></strong></code>
    the failing condition that I programmed into
    <code><strong>raceDriver.c</strong></code> to make it print the error
    message that you saw. Git add and commit as usual.</li>
  <li>At this point, we want you to use the remaining time to prepare and run
    experiments so you'll have data to analyze for homework. The goal is to
    compare running times and amounts of error due to race conditions for four
    systematic variations. This table summarizes them: 

    <table border="1">
      <caption></caption>
      <col />
      <col />
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><code><strong>raceDriver-</strong></code><br />
            not optimized <code><strong>racer()</strong></code>. <br />
            not <code><strong>volatile sharedInt</strong></code>.</td>
          <td><code><strong>raceDriver-volatile</strong></code><br />
            not optimized <code><strong>racer( )</strong></code>.<br />
            <code><strong>volatile sharedInt</strong></code>.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code><strong>raceDriver--O3</strong></code><br />
            <code><strong>-O3</strong></code> optimized
            <code><strong>racer()</strong></code>.<br />
            not <code><strong>volatile sharedInt</strong></code>.</td>
          <td><code><strong>raceDriver-volatile-O3</strong></code><br />
            <code><strong>-O3</strong></code> optimized <code><strong>racer(
            )</strong></code>.<br />
            <code><strong>volatile sharedInt</strong></code>.</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>You build the three other executable files by, three times, the steps:
    <br />
    <code><strong>make config</strong></code>, <br />
    edit the configuration setting as directed by the instructions written as
    comments, <br />
    save/exit, <br />
    <code><strong>make</strong></code></li>
  <li>Of course, confirm with <code><strong>ls -l raceDriver*</strong></code>
    that you have ALL 4 executable files. It's a good idea to run them for a
    preliminary test.</li>
  <li>Read the explanations below, but don't do anything until you've
    understood the goal and read how to do the scripting and data capture. <br
    />
    For each of the four software variations, we want you to do and time a
    total of 9 runs, of course capturing in computer files what each run was,
    what it printed, and the timing report: 
    <p>run 3 times    <strong><code>time
    ./raceDriver-</code></strong><em>VARIATION</em>     <strong><code>1
    </code></strong></p>
    <p>and then 3 times    <strong><code>time
    ./raceDriver-</code></strong><em>VARIATION</em>    <strong><code>2
    </code></strong></p>
    <p>and finally 3 times    <strong><code>time
    ./raceDriver-</code></strong><em>VARIATION</em>    <strong><code>10</code></strong></p>
    <p>Yes, that is 36 runs altogether. What you must do is script them ahead
    of time and make the computer record the results in a file. But, DON'T do
    that with changing the C code at all.</p>
    <p>Here is a "shell script" that commands two runs: </p>
    <pre><strong>#!/bin/bash
set -v  #This shell variable setting tells bash <br />      #to reprint each command before running it.
echo  xxxx  #echo reprints its argument; good for nicer spacing.
time ./raceDriver- 2
echo xxxx
time ./raceDriver- 2
cat /proc/cpuinfo  #Record what the kernel found out about your CPU</strong></pre>
    <p>Unlike a file of commands that tell <em>your interactive shell
    process</em> to read and follow (with the
    <strong><code>source</code></strong> command), a shell script in this form
    will be followed by a <strong>SEPARATE shell process</strong>. This is good
    here because you don't want the <strong><code>set -v</code></strong>
    setting to mess up the shell you are interacting with.</p>
    <p>To make the system run a separate process, you must, after saving the
    script into a file like <strong><code>do-variation.sh</code></strong>
    <strong>and then command:<code>chmod 755 do-variation.sh</code></strong>.
    After the <strong><code>chmod</code></strong> command, do ls -l and see
    that the file now has the protections
    <strong><code>-rwx-r-xr-x</code></strong>. To make the system create a
    process to run the script, just command:
    <strong><code>./do-variation.sh</code></strong> </p>
    <p>Finally, we must tell you how to make the printout GET RECORDED IN A
    FILE. Here's how</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Command: <strong><code>script variation.record</code></strong><br />
        Now everything you see including what you type is recorded in the file
        named <strong><code>variation.record</code></strong>. </li>
      <li>Command:<strong><code>./do-variation.sh</code></strong> </li>
      <li>IMPORTANT: STOP the recording by typing type
        <strong>Control-<code>d</code></strong><br />
        Note and MEMORIZE: <strong>Control-<code>d</code></strong> tells the
        keyboard input device to set the END-OF-FILE condition on the input
        file. </li>
      <li>Command: <code><strong>less variation.record</strong></code> to see
        what you've captured.</li>
      <li>Warning: If you run <code><strong>script</strong></code> with the
        same record file, the old record contents will be lost. </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong><span style="font-size: 16pt">Now, begin writing and using one
    or more shell scripts</span></strong> to script the experiments, getting
    help in lab etc. WHAT WILL COUNT in the grading is that you NAME the shell
    scripts with names that INFORM you and others </p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Lab Followup Homework (DUE next week, assuming the channel for
    pushing your CSI500 repository to our grading server is working):</strong>
    After successfully getting, saving, and <code><strong>git
    add/committ</strong></code>ing your experimental data, write a report about
    the differences and similarities among the results from the four software
    variations. Of course, <code><strong>git add</strong></code> and
    <code><strong>git commit</strong></code> the report as you progress and
    when you finish. Then answer the remaining questions (of course,
    <code><strong>git add</strong></code> and
    <code><strong>commit</strong></code> them too.)</li>
  <li><a href="HW02Questions.txt">Lab Homework Questions: Answer in the text
    file, git add it, git commit it for eventual grading.</a></li>
  <li><strong>Proj2 Assignment:</strong> 
    <ol>
      <li>Make directory <code><strong>Projs/Proj2</strong></code> and copy the
        source files from <strong><code>Labs/Lab03</code></strong> to
        <code><strong>Projs/Proj2</strong></code> <br />
        Make sure the copy builds ok, and then <code><strong>git
        add</strong></code> and <code><strong>git commit</strong></code> the
        source files in <code><strong>Projs/Proj2</strong></code></li>
      <li>Just concentrate on the <strong><em>optimized-volatile</em></strong>
        variation. Your job is to remove the race condition by using a pthreads
        mutex. Verify that all the counting is consistant. Experiment and
        report how the performance is different between the program that
        suffers from races and the error-free program. git add and commit your
        work. By the due date of Sept 24 we should have the channel for you to
        push your CSI500 repository to the grading server operational. </li>
