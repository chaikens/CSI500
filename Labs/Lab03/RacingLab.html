<h1>Introduction to Racing Threads Lab.</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Go into your <code><strong>CSI500</strong></code> directory that should
    contain our CSI500 git repository which you started with <code><strong>git
    clone git@github.com:chaikens/CSI500</strong></code>, and which you added
    to during previous labs. Do the command below: 
    <p></p>
    <pre><strong>git pull origin master</strong></pre>
    <p>A text editor might take over your terminal window with a comment about
    this being a merge. Just exit the editor. By default it will be the vi
    editor, and the commands to simply exit without changing any text are
    <code><strong>ESC :wq </strong></code>(That's the Escape key. The ESC stops
    text edit mode and <code><strong>:wq</strong></code> tells
    <code><strong>vi</strong></code> to write out the file and quit.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>Make your shell change working directory to
    <code><strong>Labs/Lab03</strong></code>
    (<code><strong>c</strong></code>hange <code><strong>w</strong></code>orking
    <code><strong>d</strong></code>irectory)) and use <code><strong>ls -l
    </strong></code> to see what we gave you. WRITE IN YOUR NOTES, or better,
    KEEP A COPY OF those file names BEFORE you proceed with making more files.
    Please command: <code><strong>ls -l &gt; files_before_making
    </strong></code>
    <p style="margin-left:2em;">(The <code><strong>&gt; </strong></code>symbol
    in this shell command tells the shell to open a disk file named
    <code><strong>files_before_making</strong></code> and <strong
    style="font-size: 14pt">redirect</strong> the standard output file
    descriptor so it describes this disk file instead of the text terminal.)
    </p>
    <p>Q1: Copy into the file <code><strong>HW2Questions.txt</strong></code>
    this list of files. </p>
    <p>We will ask you to report what new files are commanded to be made by the
    <code><strong>Makefile</strong></code>. You should only pay attention to
    the files at the top level of directory
    <code><strong>Lab03</strong></code>, not any in the subdirectories.</p>
  </li>
  <li>View in your text editor 
    <p>first, <code><strong>racer.c</strong></code>: It has a loop that makes
    the thread repeatedly add 1 to a shared variable in memory (apparently).
    </p>
    <p>second, <code><strong>racer.h</strong></code>: The interface to the
    <code><strong>racer</strong></code> function.</p>
    <p>third, <code><strong>raceDriver.c</strong></code>: Don't spend time
    studying it all now, but note that the <code><strong>racer</strong></code>
    function is NOT CALLED EXPLICITLY with
    <code><strong>racer(</strong></code>ANYTHING<code><strong>);</strong></code>
    but rather its name is one argument in the POSIX call to create a thread
    and get it to run the <code><strong>racer</strong></code> loop.</p>
    <p></p>
    <pre><strong> pthread_create(&amp;threads[i], NULL, racer, (void *) i);</strong></pre>
    <p style="margin-left:2em;"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Important C rule
    in kernel programming: The plain name of a function, with no ()'s, denotes
    the address of the first machine instruction of the function's body. In
    other words, the name denotes the function pointer pointing to that
    function. (Note this rule is similar to the one about arrays: The plain
    name denotes the address of the first element and the name followed by
    [ANYTHING] denotes the variable that happens to be the array element with
    index given by the value denoted by ANYTHING.)</span> </p>
  </li>
  <li>Command: <code><strong>make help </strong></code>(When you
    <strong><code>make help</code> </strong>at the top of a Linux kernel source
    tree, you get instructions like this.)<strong></strong></li>
  <li>Command: <code><strong>make config</strong></code> Leave the contents of
    the editor buffer unchanged by typing <code><strong>C-x</strong></code>
    Next, command: <code><strong>make </strong>
    <br/> (<strong>make&nbsp;
    </strong></code><strong><em>some configuration</em></strong> followed by
    <code><strong>make </strong></code> to make what you want
    is a common pattern of work followed people who build kernels.)</li>
  <li>LAB Q2: Write in the file <code><strong>HW2Questions.txt</strong></code>
    the names of the files (top level only) made during the last step. 
    <p>Command: <code><strong>git add HW2Questions.txt </strong></code> and
    <strong><code>git commit -m "Did the first make and answered
    Q2"</code></strong> </p>
    <p>Finally, command: <strong><code>git log -p</code></strong> (Note
    <code><strong>-p</strong></code> here stands for
    <strong><em>patch</em></strong>.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>LAB Q3: Describe, quoting the code if you like in
    <code><strong><code>HW2Questions.txt</code></strong></code><code><strong></strong></code>
    the failing condition that I programmed into
    <code><strong>raceDriver.c</strong></code> to make it print the error
    message that you saw. <em><strong>Git add and commit as
  usual.</strong></em></li>
  <li>At this point, we want you to use the remaining time to prepare and run
    experiments so you'll have data to analyze for homework. The goal is to
    compare running times and amounts of error due to race conditions for four
    systematic variations. Here is a summary: 

    <table border="1">
      <caption></caption>
      <col />
      <col />
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><code><strong>raceDriver-</strong></code><br />
            not optimized <code><strong>racer()</strong></code>. <br />
            not <code><strong>volatile sharedInt</strong></code>.</td>
          <td><code><strong>raceDriver-volatile</strong></code><br />
            not optimized <code><strong>racer( )</strong></code>.<br />
            <code><strong>volatile sharedInt</strong></code>.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code><strong>raceDriver--O3</strong></code><br />
            <code><strong>-O3</strong></code> optimized
            <code><strong>racer()</strong></code>.<br />
            not <code><strong>volatile sharedInt</strong></code>.</td>
          <td><code><strong>raceDriver-volatile-O3</strong></code><br />
            <code><strong>-O3</strong></code> optimized <code><strong>racer(
            )</strong></code>.<br />
            <code><strong>volatile sharedInt</strong></code>.</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>Please build the three other executable files by doing, three times,
    these steps: <br />
    <code><strong>make config</strong></code>, <br />
    edit the configuration setting as directed by the comment instructions you
    will see, <br />
    save/exit, <br />
    <code><strong>make</strong></code></li>
  <li>Of course, confirm with <code><strong>ls -l raceDriver*</strong></code>
    that you have ALL 4 executable files. It's a good idea to run them for a
    preliminary test.</li>
  <li>Read the explanations below, but don't do anything until you've
    understood the goal and read how to do the scripting and data capture. <br
    />
    For each of the four software variations, we want you to do a total of 9
    <strong><em>timed</em></strong> runs, of course capturing in computer files
    what each run was, what it printed, and how much time it took: (Do
    <code><strong>man time</strong></code>, pick section 1 for commands, and
    take a quick look.) 
    <p>run 3 times    <strong><code>time
    ./raceDriver-</code></strong><em>VARIATION</em>     <strong><code>1
    </code></strong></p>
    <p>and then 3 times    <strong><code>time
    ./raceDriver-</code></strong><em>VARIATION</em>    <strong><code>2
    </code></strong></p>
    <p>and finally 3 times    <strong><code>time
    ./raceDriver-</code></strong><em>VARIATION</em>    <strong><code>10</code></strong></p>
    <p>Yes, that is 36 runs altogether. What you must do is
    <em><strong>script</strong></em> them ahead of time and make the computer
    record the results in a file. But, DON'T do that with changing the C code
    at all.</p>
    <p>Here is a "shell script" that commands two runs: </p>
    <pre><strong>#!/bin/bash
set -v  #This shell variable setting tells bash <br />      #to reprint each command before running it.
echo  xxxx  #echo reprints its argument; good for nicer spacing.
time    ./raceDriver-    2
echo xxxx
time    ./raceDriver-    2
cat /proc/cpuinfo  #Record what the kernel found out about your CPU</strong></pre>
    <p>Unlike a file of commands that <em>your interactive shell process</em>
    to read and follow (with the <strong><code>source</code></strong> command),
    a shell script in this form will be followed by a <strong>SEPARATE shell
    process</strong>. This is good here because you don't want the
    <strong><code>set -v</code></strong> setting to mess up the shell you are
    interacting with.</p>
    <p>To make the system run a separate process, you must, after saving the
    script into a file like <strong><code>do-variation.sh</code></strong> </p>
    <p><strong>and then command:<code>chmod 755
    do-variation.sh</code></strong>. </p>
    <p>After the <strong><code>chmod</code></strong> command, do
    <code><strong>ls -l</strong></code> and see that the file now has the
    protections <strong><code>-rwx-r-xr-x</code></strong>. </p>
    <p>To make the system create a process to run the script, just command:
    <strong><code>./do-variation.sh</code></strong> </p>
    <p>Finally, we must tell you how to make the printout GET RECORDED IN A
    FILE. Here's how:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Command: <strong><code>script variation.record</code></strong><br />
        Now everything new you see, including what you type, is recorded in the
        file named <strong><code>variation.record</code></strong>. </li>
      <li>Command:<strong><code>./do-variation.sh</code></strong> </li>
      <li>IMPORTANT: STOP the recording by typing type
        <strong>Control-<code>d</code></strong><span
        style="font-size: 14pt"><br />
        Note and MEMORIZE: <strong>Control-<code>d</code></strong> tells the
        keyboard input device to set the END-OF-FILE condition on the input
        file.</span> </li>
      <li>Command: <code><strong>less variation.record</strong></code> to see
        what you've captured.</li>
      <li>Warning: If you run <code><strong>script</strong></code> with the
        same record file again, the old record contents will be lost. If you
        omit what file you want, script will name that file
        <code><strong>typescript</strong></code>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong><span style="font-size: 16pt">Now, begin writing and using one
    or more shell scripts</span></strong> to script the experiments, getting
    help in lab etc. </p>
    <p>WHAT WILL COUNT in the grading is that you NAME the shell scripts and
    the record files with names that INFORM you and others what they contain.
    Make a note of what file or files contain the experimental data, plus the
    shell script or scripts you used, and <code><strong>git add</strong></code>
    them all.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Lab Followup Homework (DUE next week, assuming the channel for
    pushing your CSI500 repository to our grading server is working):</strong> 
    <p>After successfully getting, saving, and <code><strong>git
    add/committ</strong></code>ing your experimental data and scripts you used
    to create that data, write a report about the differences and similarities
    among the results from the four software variations. Of course,
    <code><strong>git add</strong></code> and <code><strong>git
    commit</strong></code> the report as you progress and when you finish. Then
    answer the remaining questions (of course, <code><strong>git
    add</strong></code> and <code><strong>commit</strong></code> them too.)</p>
  </li>
  <li><a href="HW02Questions.txt">Lab Homework Questions: Answer in the text
    file, git add it, git commit it for eventual grading.</a></li>
  <li><strong>Proj2 Assignment:</strong> 
    <ol>
      <li>Make directory <code><strong>Projs/Proj2</strong></code> and copy the
        source files from <strong><code>Labs/Lab03</code></strong> to
        <code><strong>Projs/Proj2</strong></code> <br />
        Make sure the copy builds ok with the configuration to optimize -O3 and
        make <code><strong>shareInt</strong></code> volatile, and then
        <code><strong>git add</strong></code> and <code><strong>git
        commit</strong></code> the source files in
        <code><strong>Projs/Proj2</strong></code> Of course, the commit message
        should say something like <code><strong>"Starting
      Proj2"</strong></code></li>
      <li>Just concentrate on the <strong><em>optimized-volatile</em></strong>
        variation. Your job is to remove the race condition by using a pthreads
        mutex. Verify that all the counting is consistant. Experiment and
        report how the performance (performance here means
        <em><strong>computing speed</strong></em>) is different between the
        program that suffers from races and the error-free program. git add and
        commit your work. By the due date of Sept 24 we should have the channel
        for you to push your CSI500 repository to the grading server
        operational. </li>
    </ol>
