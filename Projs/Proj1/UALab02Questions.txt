Answer:

What does the unix_error( ) function do?
Answer:


Temporarilly disable #include "csapp.h" by putting // right before #.  Run the
compile command gcc -g -pthread -c csapp.c.  Briefly, what sort of errors occur?
Answer:


Examine csapp.h.  When you use Bryant&O'Hallaron's syscall wrapper and Robust I/O (Rio) library, in which .c files must you use #include "csapp.h"
Answer:( )It's optional.  ( )csapp.c only.  
( )your files where wrapper or Rio functions are called only.
( )both in csapp.c AND in your files were wrapper or Rio functions are called. 

In your shell window, run man pthread_create.  View the section 3 page, not the
section 3p one.  Want linker option must you use in a Gnu/Linux system when
you building executables may call pthread_create or other pthread functions?
Answer:


Study the parseline( ) code of shellex.c.
What causes the comment on char *delim; /* Points to the first space delimiter */
to become true?
Answer:
( ) The fact that a local variable, allocated in the stack like delim,
    has a garbage initial value.
( ) The untrue assumption that local variables are initialized to 0.
( ) The loop to /* Ignore leading spaces */
( ) The first time delim gets a non-garbage value is the first iteration of the
    while ((delim = strchr( ... loop.
( ) That entire while loop ALWAYS makes delim point to the first space delimiter.

What is the best comment for char *delim;?
Answer:
( ) B&Os original /* Points to the first space delimiter */
( ) /* Points to the first and subsequent spaces right after tokens.


Consult man strchr and copy the one line that documents succinctly what it does.
Answer: 


After the space following the last token is replaced by the null character '\0',
what is the value returned by the next call to strchr( )?
Answer: 
( ) 0 or NULL
( ) a non-null pointer that points to a null ('\0') character. 

Copy here the ACTUAL ONE LINE OF CODE that causes the C string consisting of 
what the user inputted TO BE BROKEN UP into multiple C strings so the user
input can be processed as a sequence of tokens.  Note that before the 
tokenization, the input is stored with only one null character (0 or '\0') at
its end.  After tokenization, additional null characters are stored into the
character array after the logic detects the end of a token.
